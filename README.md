Java internationalization (jI18N)
=================================

A simple tool for generating, using and updating language maps for
various applications. Main motive for this work is having a general
library for loading language strings, independent of java environment.

Dependencies
------------

The library currently depend on [Google
JSON](http://code.google.com/p/google-gson/), which needs to be in your
library path when using this tool.  This dependency will (most likely)
be removed in a future update.

Usage
----- 

The tool can be used on several platforms including
[Android](http://developer.android.com/guide/basics/what-is-android.html),
[Libgdx](http://code.google.com/p/libgdx/) and for generic Java
applications. Usage on each platform will be described below.

### Adding to a project

Export source-files to a .jar-file, add to libs/-folder of project, and
include in classpath. Exported files will be available for direct
download later.

### Using in a project

TODO (should be kind of self explanatory at the moment).
